To run, do the following:

make clean

make

Enter the number of data points you want to access.

If it is more than the available points in the data, it will compute only the first 5 points in the raw data.

You will have access to the points you used (first two columns), magnitude (third column), whole number for Y (fourth column), and the recursive power (fifth column) in a text file.

You will get another text file stores the linear fit equation and ChiSquare.

You can compute by entering Y.
